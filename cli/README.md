## CLI for Indy Ledger

This is command line interface for Indy, which provides a distributed-ledger-based
foundation for self-sovereign identity. 

It provides the commands to:
* Manage wallets
* Manage pool configurations
* Manage DIDs
* Sending transactions to distributed ledger

### Execution modes
CLI supports 2 execution modes:
* Interactive:
  * In this mode CLI reads commands from terminal interactively. 
  * To start this mode just run `indy-cli-rs` without params.
* Batch:
  * In this mode all commands will be read from a text file or pipe and executed in series. 
  * To start this mode run `indy-cli-rs <path-to-text-file>`. 
  * Batch mode supports the same commands as interactive mode. 
  * Note that by default if some command finishes with an error batch execution will be interrupted. 
    * To prevent this start command with `-`.
    * For example, `-wallet create test`. In this case the result of this command will be ignored. 
  * To make a comment in the batch script start the line with the `#` symbol.

### Getting help
* The most simple way is just start cli by `indy-cli-rs` command and put `help` command. 
* Also, you can refer to [CLI design document](docs/README.md) containing the list of commands and architecture overview.

### Options
* -h and --help - Print usage.
* --logger-config - Init logger according to a config file (default no logger initialized).
* --config - Define config file for CLI initialization. A config file can contain the following fields:
    * loggerConfig - path to a logger config file (is equal to usage of "--logger-config" option).
    * taaAcceptanceMechanism - transaction author agreement acceptance mechanism to be used when sending write transactions to the Ledger.
* --plugins - **DEPRECATED** Load plugins in Libindy (usage: <lib-1-name>:<init-func-1-name>,...,<lib-n-name>:<init-func-n-name>).

### Compatibility with [Indy-CLI](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/main/cli)
* The names and parameters for all commands are preserved compared to the **old** Indy-CLI.
* Payment related commands and functionality are **not** included into **this** CLI.
* Pool Ledger created by the **old** Indy-CLI **can** be also opened using **this** CLI.
* Wallet created by the **old** Indy-CLI **cannot** be opened using **this** CLI due to different storage format.
* Wallet backup created by the **old** Indy-CLI **can** be imported using **this** CLI due to different backup format.

### Migration of wallet created by old [Indy-CLI](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/main/cli)
1. Run old CLI and create wallet backup
```
indy-cli> wallet open wallet_to_export key
indy-cli> wallet export export_path=/Users/home/backup export_key
indy-cli> wallet close
```
2. Run new CLI and import wallet
```
indy-cli-rs> wallet import wallet_imported key export_path=/Users/home/backup export_key
```

### Troubleshooting
CLI depends on `term` rust library that has a system dependency on terminfo database.
That is why CLI Debian package additionally installs `libncursesw5-dev` library.
